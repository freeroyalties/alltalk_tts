USAGE NOTES
Separate Execution: Run this script independently in its own command prompt or terminal window, separate from AllTalk's operational environment.

JSON File Requirement: After TTS generation, export your list as ttsList.json and ensure it is located in the same directory as ttsgencomp.py.

Iterative Process: Should you need to regenerate TTS for any flagged IDs, repeat the export and script execution process with your updated JSON list.

CUDA Dependency: Similar to AllTalk's finetuning, this script requires access to cublas64_11. Ensure your system meets the necessary requirements.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Ensure your active the Python environment that AllTalk runs in & Ensure you have the CUDA dependency set up (link above)

2) Install the required packages using pip:

pip install faster-whisper fuzzywuzzy spacy levenshtein

3) Download the language model en_core_web_md for Spacy:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

4) Generate your TTS in the TTS Generator and export the ttsList.JSON to .../alltalk_tts/templates/ttsgencomp/

5) Ensure you're in the directory where ttsgencomp.py is located (Replace /path/to/ with the actual path to the .../alltalk_tts/templates/ttsgencomp/ directory):

cd /path/to/alltalk_tts/templates/ttsgencomp/

6) Run the script using Python:

python ttsgencomp.py

7) Follow any on screen instructions.
