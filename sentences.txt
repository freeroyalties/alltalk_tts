Don’t let your past dictate who you are, but let it be part of who you will become.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
Great things never came from comfort zones.
Believe in yourself, take on your challenges, dig deep within yourself to conquer fears. Never let anyone bring you down. You got this.
I’ma keep going ’til I touch the sky, even when they tell me that I won’t survive.
I’ma keep on fighting when the road gets tough, I won’t give up, I won’t give up.
I can’t change the past, but I can shape the future, so I’ll keep moving forward, I won’t let it hold me back.
No matter how hard life gets, I won’t let it break me, I’ll rise above the pain and keep pushing forward.
I’ve been knocked down before, but I always get back up, I won’t let anything keep me down.
